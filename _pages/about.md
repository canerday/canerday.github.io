This is a personal blog that I am editing in order to learn about Jekyll, git, and github.  I always enjoy pushing the boundries and learning something new.  This time, I am learning about designing, deploying, testing, and editing a static blog.  If your not me, then thanks for looking!  Also, I would like to take the time to thank the people who have published tutorials and articles about jekyll.  
Most notably:

[The tutorial at scotch.io](https://scotch.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-jekyll-plus-a-free-bootstrap-3-starter-theme)

[David Burela's Post on installing jekyll on windows](https://davidburela.wordpress.com/2015/11/28/easily-install-jekyll-on-windows-with-3-command-prompt-entries-and-chocolatey/)

[Roger Rudler's Git Guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
