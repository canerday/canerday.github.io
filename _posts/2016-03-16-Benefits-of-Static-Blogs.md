The creation and implimentation of static sites has been growing in popularity recently.  They are no longer being seen as a novelty site that brings back memorys of listening to ice ice baby while driving in your 5.0 with your top down low.  No, no indeed, they are making a comeback.  Just as the techno savy laggers are finally catching up with the whole idea of dynamic websites, the trend is now shifting toward what can be called dynamically static websites.  When people discuss websites today, most will mean a blog of some sort.  And when you are discussing blogs, inevitably you are discussing Wordpress.  If people are finally catching up with being able to create their own dyanically created Wordpress site, then why are people switching over to static websites?  Well the answer will not suprise you if you take at the benefits that they offer.

You will mostly hear that staic sites are "not for everyone," and many of the people saying that would be correct.  There is no UI for a content manager to log into and fiddle with.  When you deal with static websites you are mostly talking about people who have no problem whipping open a text editor.  In fact this is being typed out in sublime text. So I ask the question, why consider using static sites when dynamic one are so easy to create nowadays?

Well, as I have learned easy is easier, but easy is not necessarily better.  Just as new is not always better.  I'm sure you have seen examples of this elsewhere in your life.  Dynamic website may be easy to get new content into (actually they are about the same, but that depends on your tech savy level), but they are heavy slogs that trudge through the  knee high mud in order to show you the information contain within their site.  This is one are that static websites really shine.

A dyanmic website has to connect to its database, parse through the information, return it, format it, then serve it up to your viewport; where as a static website serves your viewport the information and lets your browser format it (hopefully correctly).  The area of speed is a great concern with viewing webpages, and for servers displaying them.  This is an area that a static website blows the doors off of a dynamic website.  This also translates into the area of cost.

The cost of hosting a dyanmic website has its ranges, just like everything else, but you need way less resources and backend processing power in order to quickly display the website.  While the website is being looked up, a static site will have it already displayed.  I have heard others getting something around a 6X increase in performance.  Not bad eh?
